					<p>Engineers by profession, film-makers by passion</p>
				</header>
				<p>We are a bunch of enthusiastic, like-minded, fun-loving individuals coming from different backgrounds, holding different
					engineering degrees, working for different IT companies, but one thing that really brought us together was the passion
					to pursue our passion in indulging something creative. Since theatre was our forte, we thought of extending that passion
					even further and involve ourselves in making films to quench our creative thirst. That was when by2coffee films was
					formed. We learnt the art-form and started making meaningful short films which resonated hearts and minds of the people.
					Winning awards at reputed film festivals provided huge boost to our confidence and gave us enough encouragement to try
					something big, something new, something more challenging... and we as a team have embarked on that journey!</p>
